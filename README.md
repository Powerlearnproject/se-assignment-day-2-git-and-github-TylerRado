## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Answer for version control concepts
- Repository: Also called a "repo," a repository is the centralized database that stores the complete   collection of files and folders 
  for a  codebase, along with the revision history.
- Pull request: The mechanism developers use to propose, notate, review, and discuss the changes before they merge updates into the main 
  codebase is a pull request. A pull request is also known as a merge request.
- Commit: A commit is a snapshot of changes with a unique "hash" that identifies the proposed changes. A commit can include notes and 
  messages between developers.
- Branch: A code branch is a separate, parallel version of the codebase created by developers to work independently on experiments, 
  regression testing, and debugging without changing the 
  main codebase.
- Merge: When developers combine code edits, they integrate the changes from one branch into another or into the main codebase.
- Conflict: When multiple developers make edits to the code, their changes sometimes conflict.   Version control tools help developers 
  identify and resolve conflicts to keep development  moving.
- Checkout: When a developer retrieves a file from the version control system it's called a checkout.
- Tag: A tag is a marker used by contributors to label a specific point in the source code history, like the release date. Tags are also 
  used to mark a specific point in the codebase before changes.
- Remote: Remote development allows developers to do some or all their work on their local desktop, on a company server, or on the cloud.
- Fork: A fork is the process of creating a separate and distinct piece of software by copying source code from an existing software 
  package.
- Revert: Developers can revert, or undo one or more recent changes and return to the previous version.

 Answer of why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code
 -Because it allows developers that far apart from one another to share code, collaborate and track changes on a single project.

Answer for how does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
- Version control systems help eliminate common development roadblocks—like operating system limitations and soloed tool chains— 
  simplifying and streamlining development and creating 
  space for innovation that can lead to breakthroughs.
- Improves project management and product development. In fact, failure to adopt version control poses risks like data loss, sluggish 
  development, and reduced code quality.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
Answer for public repository:
Anyone on the internet can see this repository. You choose who can commit.
Advantages of public repository 
- Increase credibility
- Allows employers to see your work
- provide access to  money
Disadvantages of public repository
- It also entails the loss of control
- Increased regulatory burdens
- High market volatility.
Answer for private repository:
- You choose who can see and commit to this repository.
Advantages of private repository
- Limited access, which also means less corruption on project
- decrease regulatory burden
- Less market volatility
Disadvantages of private repository
- Not all employers will be able to see your work
- Less access to money
- decrease credibility

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
Answer for detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository.
Step 1: There should be github repository
Step 1: click README.md
Step 2: Click edit so that you can edit your repository
Step 3: Then click 'commit changes'
Step 4: On a 'make commit messages' window click on 'Extended description' to edit decriptions but is optional
Step 5: You will have an option to create new branch or main branch

Answer what are commits?
- Commits are group of changes and the message you give should tell other developers what you have been working on and why.
  Answer for how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
- commits allows versions of different types to merge so that they can be the same thing

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
- Branching  involves taking a snapshot of repository, When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small— 
 you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.
Answer of discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
- With git, we create branch by writing 'git brach main' if you targeting a main.
- But on Github Firstly you should have a repository
- step 1: on 'commit message window' edit on README.dm
- Step 3: give it a name
- Step 4: on commit changes window click on create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request
## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
- A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.
  
## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
- A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository.
- Forking creates your own copy of a repository in a remote location (for example, GitHub). Your own copy means that you will be able to 
 contribute changes to your copy of the repository without affecting the original repository. Cloning makes a local copy of a 
 repository, not your own copy.
- Forking plays a vital role in enabling collaboration among developers. It provides the flexibility to experiment with changes without 
  affecting the original codebase. It also allows developers to propose changes and improvements to existing projects by submitting a 
  pull request from their forked repository. Additionally, forking helps in maintaining a clear separation between the original project 
  and any personal modifications or extensions made by individuals or organizations.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
- ssues let you track your work on GitHub. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work.
- Use GitHub Issues to track ideas and work on GitHub
- About slash commands
- Slash commands can save you time by reducing the typing required to create complex Markdown.
- Linking a pull request to an issue
  You can link a pull request or branch to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when the pull 
  request or branch is merged.
- Creating a branch to work on an issue
  You can create a branch to work on an issue directly from the issue page and get started right away.

 - Assigning issues and pull requests to other GitHub users
   Assignees clarify who is working on specific issues and pull requests.
 - Viewing all of your issues and pull requests
   The Issues and Pull Request dashboards list the open issues and pull requests you've created. You can use them to update items that 
   have gone stale, close them, or keep track of where you've been mentioned across all repositories—including those you're not 
   subscribed to.
 - Filtering and searching issues and pull requests
   To find detailed information about a repository on GitHub, you can filter, sort, and search issues and pull requests that are 
   relevant to the repository.
 - Marking issues or pull requests as a duplicate
   Mark an issue or pull request as a duplicate to track similar issues or pull requests together and remove unnecessary burden for both 
   maintainers and collaborators.
 - Pinning an issue to your repository
   You can pin up to three important issues above the issues list in your repository.
 - Transferring an issue to another repository
    To move an issue to a better fitting repository, you can transfer open issues to other repositories.
 - Closing an issue
   You can close an issue when bugs are fixed, feedback is acted on, or to show that work is not planned.
 - Deleting an issue
   People with admin permissions in a repository can permanently delete an issue from a repository.
 - Planning and tracking work for your team or project
   The essentials for using GitHub's planning and tracking tools to manage work on a team or project.
